# Cowin_Pinger
A simple app to check availability of covid vaccine slots in real time using the open CoWin API
___

## TODO:
1. Implement push notifications using firebase server
2. Implement logic for continuous process (probably using set interval to call the API)
3. Make all the above logic work in background even when app is not being used
